amin:
Sorry for bothering u so much. I have difficulties undersanding the whole program:
the user enter something in html file, ritgh? so we need to connect html5 via c++? but how?
then we nee to run the server to catch info from Twitter and store them in mango db and response the page the hist? 
or do we need JS to retrive data from manodb and just show it? what is the final connection of server and histogram, then?

Mohamed:
I think from the html we send request to the cpprestsdk server , 
then the server will get tweets from mongodb and send it back to client to show it in html as histogram

Amin : 
I have one problem here, when we send request to cpprestsdk, we use twitterClient codes(similar) to get the matching tags, right?
 then we store it in MangoDB as one seperate result?
 after that how are we going to get mangoDB result to html5 file?
 And are we just shoing last mangoDB to user or all mangodb or the related one?
 
 
Mohamed:
To get back a response from the server in html , I used something called xmlhttprequest , so from a web browser , 
the client will enter a query, then we send the query to the server to look for it in mongodb, 
then the server send back json data to html to show it as histogram






works:
1-manage to work with cpprestsdk example // use it to connect to server, mangodb  and get back the result --> Done!
2-use client.cc to get the result from user //and store it in mangodb
3-finish loading the result using html5 and JS library




note 1 : change the way u store the data --- tags to store
/data --> get json from twiter api
